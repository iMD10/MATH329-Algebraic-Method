# MATH329-Algebraic-Method

A Python-based tool for solving Linear Programming Problems (LPP) using the algebraic method. This project is designed to provide an efficient way to solve LPPs through both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI). It leverages the powerful numerical computing capabilities of NumPy.

## Introduction

This project is a Python implementation of the algebraic method for solving Linear Programming Problems (LPP). It is aimed at helping students and professionals understand and apply LPP solutions in an intuitive and user-friendly manner. 

Key aspects include:
- **CLI Tool** for users who prefer command-line operations.
- **GUI Application** for a more interactive experience.

The project is part of the MATH329 coursework and uses NumPy to handle matrix operations efficiently.

---

## Features

- Solve Linear Programming Problems using the algebraic method.
- Two user interfaces: 
  - Command-Line Interface (CLI)
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Easy-to-understand results and outputs.
- Dependency on Python's robust `numpy` library for numerical computations.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iMD10/MATH329-Algebraic-Method.git
   cd MATH329-Algebraic-Method
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

---

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the CLI script:
   ```bash
   python CLIAlgebric.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to input problem constraints and objectives.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the GUI script:
   ```bash
   python GUIAlgebric.py
   ```
3. Use the interactive interface to input the problem details and view the solution.

---

## Dependencies

The project depends on the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` (for matrix operations and numerical computations)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(*Ensure you create a `requirements.txt` file listing the dependencies.*)

---

## Configuration

There is no additional configuration required. Ensure Python 3.x and the required dependencies are installed.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`
  - **Solution:** Ensure NumPy is installed by running `pip install numpy`.

- **GUI not opening:**
  - Ensure you have Python Tkinter installed (comes pre-installed with most Python distributions).
